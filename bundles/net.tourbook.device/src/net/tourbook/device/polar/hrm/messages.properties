Import_Confirm_PPD = You are about to import a PPD (Polar Person Definition).\n\
                     \n\
                     ATTENTION: Importing a PPD file might not do what you expect!\n\
                     \n\
                     The current implementation imports ALL EXCERSICES\n\
                     of the person described in that PPD file. Additionally\n\
                     all "sports" defined in the PDD files are created\n\
                     as "types" and assigned to the imported file.\n\
                     \n\
                     So effectively the PPD import is migrating all your\n\
                     Polar ProTrainer into MyTourBook (while leaving the\n\
                     original data untouched).\n\
                     \n\
                     Further implementations might allow you to import the person\n\
                     data (age, HR-Zones, ...) as well. Thats something which currently\n\
                     needs to be done manually within MyToorBook.\n\
                     \n\
                     Please note that the import process might take some time and\n\
                     might show errors on files which can't be imported\n\
                     (eg. variable recording time, Beat-to-Beat data,... ).\n\
                     Please be patient and wait until the process finished!\n\
                     \n\
                     To continue press "Ok", to quit now press "Cancel"
