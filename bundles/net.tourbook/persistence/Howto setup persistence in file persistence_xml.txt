  These steps are necessary that hibernate do recognize new classes correctly:

   - Update persistence.xml in C:\DAT\MT\mytourbook\bundles\net.tourbook\persistence\META-INF
   - Zip META-INF folder
   - Delete persistence.zip
   - Rename META-INF.zip into persistence.zip
   
   - Copy persistence.zip into folder "net.tourbook"
   - Delete persistence.jar
   - Rename persistence.zip -> persistence.jar
   
   - Update persistence.xml in C:\DAT\MT\mytourbook\bundles\net.tourbook\src\META-INF
