# MyTourBook

## [Official Website](http://mytourbook.sourceforge.net/mytourbook/)

> It is free software to visualize and analyze tours which are recorded by a GPS device, bike- or exercise computer and ergometer.

### [Development](http://mytourbook.sourceforge.net/mytourbook/index.php/development)

The application requires Java 8

Supported Java platforms: Eclipse 3.8

#### [Translation](http://mytourbook.sourceforge.net/mytourbook/index.php/development/translation)

This chapter describes the tools how to translate MyTourbook into other languages.

Programming skills are not necessary but the Eclipse IDE is used to do the translation because it provides an environment which makes it very easy to do the translation (once the environment is installed :-) and it provides a possibility to test the translated text.

#### [Configuration](http://mytourbook.sourceforge.net/mytourbook/index.php/development/configuration)

The configuration file config.ini in the folder configuration at the location where the application is installed, contains information where the data of the application is stored.

This file contains information for the Eclipse platform and you should not make any modifications when you don't know what is the purpose of the setting.

Doing wrong modifications can cause the application to not run any more.

Modified settings will be applied when the application is restarted.

The data directory is defined in this setting:

```osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/mytourbook```
