!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm not sure if the photo workflow is too much complicated because there are so many features which can be set wrong and photos are not displayed, like a filter was activated and hides tour/photo but I tried to implement only helpful features to manage tours with photos.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Detected Problems:

* photo gallery in the tour marker dialog box it not correctly initialized, state is not set
* tooltip flickering occures only with bad display drivers !!!


Improvements


Photos + Tours view

* save photos in tour

* show number of saved photos including time adjustment

* new filter to show only tours which contain photos but the photos are not yet saved in the tour


Tour Chart view

* show/hide photo markers with/without photo tooltip

* show different photo markers for linked and saved photos 
  !!! there is a different hovering algorithm for the mouse location and photo group background color !!!


Tour Map view

* filter photos by rating stars

* set photo image size

* Problem: photos are not displayed sometimes, because they are not yet loaded, selecting another tour and reselecting the previous tour will solve it. This problem will be fixed in the next major version.


All photo galleries

* star rating can be set for photos when they are saved in a tour. When a photo is set in multiple tours, star rating can currently not be set (I hope this happens not too often)


Fixed bugs

* all average values in the tour book view are wrong, they included tours which values are not set -> average values are too small, http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=890604&aid=3599360&group_id=179799
