 * Import background image can be slow, set opacity to 0 to disable it. 
 
 
 * The embedded browser in Linux cannot show all CSS3 features, e.g. background image, gradient, box-shadow is expanding the focus therefor CSS3 is disabled.
 
 
 * Clicking on the dashboard state icon works sometimes only with the 2nd and further clicks.
