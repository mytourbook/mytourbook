webbsite:
- update java formatting on website

problems:
- avg pulse for all statistics, it includes tours without pulse
- datenübertraung hat keinen folder

recommendation:
- use KatMouse on windows

new
- polar PDD import
- italian translation
- added context menu into table/tree header to modify columns
- display hr zones
  - break time is ignored when hr zones are computed

modifications compared with previous versions
- break time is ignored when avg hr is computed
- default breaktime is set to 20 seconds and 20 m
- chart gridlines are hidden by default (to have a clearer view on the graphs) but they can be activated in the preferences  
  
improvements
- simplified first startup of the application
  - 1st person is created automatically
  - measurement system can be selected
- show tour info (with hovered mouse) in the Tour Import view
- app cleanup:
  -measurement system combobox is hidden by default
  -moved action "Other views..." into sub menu
  -moved import for daum ergo into separate pref page
- reorder table/tree columns with drag&drop in column dialog
- enforce preference min/max values for painting a tour in the map
- straight vertical lines instead of traiangles in the heartbeat graph when the value is not set within 20 seconds
- export gpx with heartrate, temperature and cadence
- break time is displayed as a gap when time is displayed on the x-axis
- tour chart:
  - tour marker can be displayed/hidden
  
limitations
- HR zones in the map can be displayed correctly for one single tour, all other possibilities (multiple tours, multiple persons) can display the wrong HR zones
