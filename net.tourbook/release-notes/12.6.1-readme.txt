Version: 12.6.1                                           2?. June 2012 

Important !!!

New behaviour in the import view: All tours will be removed (NOT 
deleted) from this view when view or application is closed. The old 
behaviour can be activated in the view menu by unchecking: "Remove all 
tours from tour import view when view or application is closed" 



New 

 * the embedded SQL server is used instead of the network based server, 
the application startup is now 2 sec faster (this setup is now the 
default, using the network sql server can be activated in the 
preferences) 



Improvements 

* better info, why the cursor is waiting when a folder is selected (the statusline displays a message how many folders needs to be loaded in the 
photo directory)





Other modifications

simple drawing method was used, this bug occured in newer Linux 
distributions
