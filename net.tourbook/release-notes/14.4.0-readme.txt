Version: 14.x.0                                       ?. ? 2014


HINT for docu
Delete 3D map images in C:\ProgramData\WorldWindData\Earth\... because it is possible that newer images are available but they are not downloaded because they are cached in these folders.


INFO
An error can occure when MT (or a perspective) is opened the first time after installing this version. The reason is that the "3D Map Layer" view is not available any more as an Eclipse view, now it's displayed as a slideout which is not an Eclipse view. This was done to have a consistent UI with slideouts to configure the 3D map.

TIP
Improve performance by disabling layers, e.g. "Bing Imagery" and "MS Virtual Earth Areal", these layers can slow down the map drawing.


New 3D Map Features 	

* Draw a line to the surface from a slider (right/left/hovered).

* Converted layer view into a slideout.

 

Improvements

* The same tour can be saved twice, however this needed to restructured the creation of the tour id for ALL supported import formats. A tour id can now be created with/without tour distance (default is without), see here for more details.


VERY IMPORTANT

.fit data files

Imported and saved .fit files from previous versions (14.2 and older) of MyTourbook are not recognized as already saved tours, because the old implementation used a wrong algorithm to create the tour id. The import of .fit files with the current version 14.4 and future versions of MyTourbook will create a different tour id. 

Already imported and saved .fit tours work as before, it's just the creation (and first save) of a tour which creates the tour id.

So, please take care when you try to import already saved .fit tours because the 'Database Status' column (first column) in the import view do not display the correct state.


Other data file formats

It's possible that other data file formats can have the same problem like the .fit files. 
During my testing this problem occured when a tour contained only a few (e.g. 2) timeslices or had other issues. 
The 'Database Status' for 'normal' imported tours should be displayed correctly.
