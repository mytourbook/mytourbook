Version 18.9.0                                                   29. August 2018


Version 18.9 is VERY Experimental
=================================

MyTourbook is now also running with Java 9/10+, that this was possible, the 
background framework had to be replaced from Eclipse 3 with Eclipse 4.

These Changes

- Eclipse 3 -> Eclipse 4
- Java 8    -> Java 9+

needed some adjustments in the application that it was running again, there are 
still some issues which could not yet been resolved, see below.

 
MyTourbook & macOS
==================

After the build process was automated a while ago, there was not much additional
work, to also build the macOS version. With Eclipse 4 it is now running almost 
as in the old days, see below.

It is NOT planned to support macOS platform,

after a few test, the app on this platform seems to be unstable. If you are 
still interested in the macOS version, it will be available in the download 
area.

 
New
===	

* Java 9 / 10 Support


Common Issues
=============	

* First App Start / Switch Perspective

  There was an issue logged when another perspective was selected but this could
  also occure in other cases, e.g. first app start, and the UI was partly 
  corrupted.

  org.eclipse.core.runtime.AssertionFailedException: null argument:Placeholder 
  net.tourbook.views.TourMarkerView does not point to a valid reference

  Workaround: After a restart, the app was working normally, in this case the 
  TourMarkerView was displayed correctly


* Search Tours View

  A tour cannot be selected with the mouse in the embedded browser (this still 
  works with an external browser), however navigating with the keyboard works in
  the embedded browser.

  Workaround: Select a tour with the mouse, the selection marker is not visible 
  and navigate with the keyboard up/down

 
* Software Update

  The features Check for Updates and Install New Software... are not working, 
  they are already rarely used

 
Win Issues 	
==========

* 2.5D Map

  This map is not displayed, it is tracked by this issue

 
Linux Issues 	
============

* 3D Map - Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)

  This map is not displayed with the exception

  Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" javax.media.opengl.GLException:

    Set a breakpoint on '_pixman_log_error' to debug


macOS Issues 	
============

* MyTourbook can crash suddenly when moving the mouse or doing other actions
* 2.5D map is not displayed correctly and can freeze the app

 
Bugfix 	
======

* Statistics View

  When tour types are not defined, the month/year statistics are empty

 
* Search POI

  Using https://... instead of http://..., http do not work anymore 

 
System 	
======

* Eclipse 4

  Eclipse 4 is the new framework which MyTourbook is using. The compatibility 
  layer is currently used with almost no E4 specific code, e.g. dependency 
  injection...


* Product Size

  The size of the product is now 12 MByte larger than before because the old 
  Eclipse 3 code is still used in the compatibility layer. The Eclipse IDE 
  (which is the main Eclipse product) is also using the same compatibility layer
  as MyTourbook
