22.next.0                                                 ?.Month 2022


TODO's
======


* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly


Issues
======

*  


Experimental
============

* 


New
===


* Tour Pauses
  - Show all tour pauses in a list

* 2D Map (Frederic)
  - Added the possibility to show/hide the tour weather icon on the map


Improvements
============

* Multiple Tours
  - Loading multiple tours is much faster because they are loaded concurrently
  - Painting multiple tours in tour chart and 2D map are further optimized 


* Tour Import
  - Sort imported tours by number of markers/waypoints
  
* Tour Segmenter
  - Show power value for each segment

    - Exif time
    - Selected adjustment time
    - Saved time
  - Show photo location in view
