TODO's
======


* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly


Issues
======

*  


Experimental
============

* 


New
===


* Tour Pauses
  - Show all tour pauses in a list

* 2D Map (Frederic)
  - Added the possibility to show/hide the tour weather icon on the map


Improvements
============

* Multiple Tours
  - Loading multiple tours is much faster because they are loaded concurrently
  - Painting multiple tours in tour chart and 2D map are further optimized 


* Tour Import
  - Sort imported tours by number of markers/waypoints
  
* Tour Segmenter
  - Show power value for each segment

* Photos + Tours        
  - Show tours with these photo times: 
    - Exif time
    - Selected adjustment time
    - Saved time
  - Show photo location in view

* SRTM
  - Additionally to the already usable SRTM3 Altitudes, SRTM1 is now also usable. The Data Files must be manually copied to the new SRTM1 folder. SRTM1 size is 25.9 MB per file. SRTM3 file size is 2.9 MB per file
