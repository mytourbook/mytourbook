22.next.0                                                 ?.Month 2022


TODO's
======


* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly


Issues
======

*  


Experimental

* SRTM (Thomas)
  - Additionally to the already usable SRTM3 Altitudes, SRTM1 is now also usable. 
    The Data Files must be manually copied to the new SRTM1 folder. 
    SRTM1 size is 25.9 MB per file. SRTM3 file size is 2.9 MB per file

Changes
=======

* Tour Editor
  - Time difference column shows now the time difference to the next time slice, until now the time difference to the previous time slice was displayed
  - A "wrong" time slice is deleted		https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/456

Bugfix
======

* Suunto App Integration (Frederic)   
  - When determining if a Suunto activity already exists in the database, only the tours for the selected user are compared with the activities available on the Suunto App

* Map25 (Thomas)
  - The old hillshading provider(wmflabs.org) is not available anymore, the new provider for hillshading is now "Mapilion"
  
* Tour Editor
  - Using DELETE in the Tour Editor is not consecutive        https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/127/
  - Canceling the tour editor still saves the changes         https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/128/
