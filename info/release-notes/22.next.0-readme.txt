TODO's
======

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly


Issues

New

* 2.5D Map
  - Draw tour track with a gradient color, the color depends on the track value, e.g. elevation

  - for better orientation, there is an optional compassrose on the map. https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/pull/899

  - Hints:
    - The color must be set to black for a gradient color with opacity
