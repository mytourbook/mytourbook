22.next.0                                                 ?.Month 2022


TODO's
======


* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

Changes
=======

* Tour Editor
  - Time difference column shows now the time difference to the next time slice, until now the time difference to the previous time slice was displayed

Bugfix
======

* Suunto App Integration (Frederic)   
  - When determining if a Suunto activity already exists in the database, only the tours for the selected user are compared with the activities available on the Suunto App

* Map25 (Thomas)
  - The old hillshading provider(wmflabs.org) is not available anymore, the new provider for hillshading is now "Mapilion"
  
* Tour Editor
  - Using DELETE in the Tour Editor is not consecutive        https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/127/
  - Canceling the tour editor still saves the changes         https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/128/

* TCX Tour Export (Frederic)
  - Removing the lat/lon tags when those values are invalid/not provided as it creates an invalid TCX file
