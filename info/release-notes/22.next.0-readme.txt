22.next.0                                                 ?.Month 2022


TODO's
======


* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly


Issues
======

*  


Experimental
============

* 


New
===

* 2D Map - Select trackpoint           https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/461
  - A trackpoint can be selected with the mouse when one tour is displayed
  - With the <Shift> key the 2nd trackpoint can be selected
  - Select in-between trackpoints can be activated/deactivated in the "2D Map Options" slideout

* 2D Map (Frederic)
  - Added the possibility to show/hide the tour weather icon on the map  

* Tour Pauses
  - Show all tour pauses in a list


Improvements
============

* Multiple Tours
  - Loading multiple tours is much faster because they are loaded concurrently
  - Painting multiple tours in tour chart and 2D map are further optimized 

* Tour Merging (Frederic)
 - Added the possibility to merge speed

* Tour Import
  - Sort imported tours by number of markers/waypoints
  - Customize simple import tiles in the easy import page 
                                        https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/460
  
* 2D Map
  - Cut off lines in pauses				https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/463
  - Enable/disable antialias painting for the tour tracks. A dimmed map may look better without antialiasing
  
* Tour Segmenter
  - Show power value for each segment	https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/feature-requests/204/

* Photos + Tours        
  - Show tours with these photo times: 
    - Exif time
    - Selected adjustment time
    - Saved time
  - Show photo location in view                         
                                        https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/449

* SRTM (Thomas)
  - Additionally to the already usable SRTM3 Altitudes, SRTM1 is now also usable. 
    The Data Files must be manually copied to the new SRTM1 folder. 
    SRTM1 size is 25.9 MB per file. SRTM3 file size is 2.9 MB per file

* Strava Integration (Frederic)   
  - Added the possibility to add the tour weather icon in the uploaded Strava activity title

* Cloud Integration (Frederic)
  - By default, sensitive data such as tokens are hidden but can be fully displayed by the user


Changes
=======

* Tour Editor
  - Time difference column shows now the time difference to the next time slice, until now the time difference to the previous time slice was displayed
  - A "wrong" time slice is deleted          https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/456
  - When time slices are deleted, then the distance differences will always be removed. 
    Until now, the distances were kept with the action "Delete Time Slices and Keep Time"
                                             https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/462

Bugfix
======

* Suunto App Integration (Frederic)   
  - When determining if a Suunto activity already exists in the database, only the tours for the selected user are compared with the activities available on the Suunto App

* Map25 (Thomas)
  - The old hillshading provider(wmflabs.org) is not available anymore, the new provider for hillshading is now "Mapilion"
  
* Tour Editor
  - Using DELETE in the Tour Editor is not consecutive        https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/127/
  - Canceling the tour editor still saves the changes         https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/128/

* TCX Tour Export (Frederic)
  - Removing the lat/lon tags when those values are invalid/not provided as it creates an invalid TCX file
