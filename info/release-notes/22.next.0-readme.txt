TODO's
======

* Update          Replace screenshot on website with correct update url

* Bundle MT with JRE       
                  https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/381#issue-971079239

* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
