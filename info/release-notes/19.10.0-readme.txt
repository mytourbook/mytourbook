19.10.0                                                      ?. October 2019

TODOs
=====

* Show weather, location start/end as new columns
* Compute min/max temperature for selected tours
* When hovering over a graph, data appears referring to the point in the graph the mouse is on: 
  this data does not take into account whether the track has been saved as a using cadence or revolutions, and always shows revolutions.

* Test import because of changed device watching task + sql exception handling
* Recommend DBeaver as a better SQL explorer
