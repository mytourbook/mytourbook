Improvements   
============

* Tour Search

  - Selecting a tour with the mouse in the tour search results is now 
    working again in the embedded browser
    https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/745a5ebd1b/#9997

 
* Tour Chart

  - Show value of the hovered graph point, can be disabled in the chart  
    options
  - Set the default graphs in the graph slideout, previously it could be 
    set only in the preferences dialog
  - Show values in the value point tooltip with the correct color when 
    using the dark theme


* 2D Map

  - Enable/disable map dimming, moved map dimming parameters into 2D Map 
    Options slideout
  - Legend units and scale colors depend on the map dim level

 
* Tour Data Editor

  - New action to delete time slices and adjust the tour start time.
    This can be helpfull when a GPS device had no connection at the tour 
    start and the tour start time is totally wrong.
    The author had a tour whose tour start time was postponed 19 hours 
    until the GPS signal was received

 
Changes

  - Enhanced the tour type comparison when mapping tour types to Strava 
    activity types
