Changes
=======

* Tour Editor
  - Time difference column shows now the time difference to the next time slice, until now the time difference to the previous time slice was displayed
  - A "wrong" time slice is deleted          https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/456
  - When time slices are deleted, then the distance differences will always be removed. 
    Until now, the distances were kept with the action "Delete Time Slices and Keep Time"

Bugfix
======

* Suunto App Integration (Frederic)   
  - When determining if a Suunto activity already exists in the database, only the tours for the selected user are compared with the activities available on the Suunto App

* Map25 (Thomas)
  - The old hillshading provider(wmflabs.org) is not available anymore, the new provider for hillshading is now "Mapilion"
  
* Tour Editor
  - Using DELETE in the Tour Editor is not consecutive        https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/127/
  - Canceling the tour editor still saves the changes         https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/128/
