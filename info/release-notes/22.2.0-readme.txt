Changes
=======

* Tour Editor

    until now the time difference to the previous time slice was displayed

    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/456
  - When time slices are deleted, then the distance differences will always be removed.

Bugfix
======

* Suunto Integration (Frederic)   
  - When determining if a Suunto activity already exists in the database, 
    only the tours for the selected user are compared with the activities 
    available on the Suunto App

* Map25 (Thomas)
  - The old hillshading provider(wmflabs.org) is not available anymore, 
    the new provider for hillshading is now "Mapilion"
  
* Tour Editor
  - Using DELETE in the Tour Editor is not consecutive            
    https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/127/
  - Canceling the tour editor still saves the changes             
    https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/128/

* TCX Tour Export (Frederic)
  - Removing the lat/lon tags when those values are invalid/not provided
