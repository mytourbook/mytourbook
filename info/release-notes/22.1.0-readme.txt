Improvements

  - Stack tour pauses that they don't overlap      https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/428
  
                              

* 2D Map
  - Filter tour pauses                             https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/428
  - Tour breadcrumbs                               https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/431

                                                   https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/433

* Tour Segmenter
  - Recompute segments when time in preferences to compute speed/pace is modified

Changes
=======

* Reverted feature: Repair close button in all views

  The command line parameter "-DsetAllViewsClosable=false" will now disable the experimental feature which was introduced in version 21.9. 
  When this value is not set in the command line, then the close button will be repaired in all views when the application is closing.


Bugfix
======

* Strava Integration: (Frederic)       
  - Manually created activities use different activity types than uploaded activities
    Official activity types list: https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/#api-models-ActivityType

* Tour Chart    
  - Show tour segment values with the correct dark color when dark theme is used
    
* 3D Map
  - Is now working with Java 17    

* Tour Segmenter
  - Use selected time in preferences to compute speed and pace, until now only the moving time was used
