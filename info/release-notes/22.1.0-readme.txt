Changes
=======

* Reverted feature: Repair close button in all views

  The command line parameter "-DsetAllViewsClosable=false" will now 
  disable the experimental feature which was introduced in version 21.9. 
  When this value is not set in the command line, then the close button 
  will be repaired in all views when the application is closing.


Bugfix
======

* Strava Integration: (Frederic)       
  - Manually created activities use different activity types than 
    uploaded activities
    Official activity types list: 
    https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/#api-models-ActivityType

* Tour Chart    
  - Show tour segment values with the correct dark color when dark theme 
    is used
    
* 3D Map
  - Is now working with Java 17    

* Tour Segmenter
  - Use selected time in preferences to compute speed and pace, until 
    now only the moving time was used

* Tour Exporter (Frederic)
  - Multiple tours are now successfully exported (GPX & TCX formats)
