Changes
=======

* Reverted feature: Repair close button in all views

  The command line parameter "-DsetAllViewsClosable=false" will now disable the experimental feature which was introduced in version 21.9. 
  When this value is not set in the command line, then the close button will be repaired in all views when the application is closing.


Bugfix
======

* Strava Integration: (Frederic)       
  - Manually created activities use different activity types than uploaded activities
    Official activity types list: https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/#api-models-ActivityType
    
* 3D Map
  - Is now working with Java 17
