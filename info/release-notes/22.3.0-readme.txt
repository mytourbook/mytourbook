New
===

* Weather Retrieval (Frederic)
  - Tour weather data improvement and new vendor addition (OpenWeatherMap) https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/479


Improvements
============

* Calendar View (Frederic)
  - The combo of years now displays the most recent years at the top as it is more likely to be selected than the oldest years
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/pull/472
    
* Tour Book View
  - Clone tour start/end location when a tour is copied                 https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/feature-requests/206/  

* Tour Chart
  - Switch between SRTM 1 and SRTM 3 values                             https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/469 

* 2D Map
  - Consolidated "Set map center when zoomed to ..."		               https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/468
  - Show more details when multiple tours are hovered                   https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/470

* Strava Integration (Frederic)   
  - Added the possibility to send the weather data in the uploaded activity's description       https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/479


Changes
=======

* Transform Opacity
  - Selecting/entering opacity values 0...100 or 0...255 is not user friendly. 
    With this new transformation, which is defined in the user preferences "Appearance/Transform Values", opacity values could be selected between e.g. 0...8 which is then transformed into 0...255
  - It is possible, that existing opacity values must be adjusted because they are not migrated

* Tour Chart
  - Moved the options
    - Graph line transparency
    - Draw line graphs with antialiasing
    from the pref page into the chart options slideout

* 2D Map
  - Moved action "Show earth map" from the toolbar into the map context menu

Bugfix

* Suunto Integration (Frederic)
