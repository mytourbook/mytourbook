    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/479


Improvements

    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/469

    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/493
  - Export and import all values of a tour
  - Limits/behavior:
    - A device sensor is not created, when sensor values for it are available
    - Body weight is overwritten when tour is saved and when 
      "Set the persons's weight ..." is selected in the "Import" preferences

Changes
=======

* Transform Opacity
  - Selecting/entering opacity values 0...100 or 0...255 is not user friendly. 
    With this new transformation, which is defined in the user preferences 
    "Appearance/Transform Values", opacity values could be selected 
    between e.g. 0...8 which is then transformed into 0...255
  - It is possible, that existing opacity values must be adjusted because 
    they are not migrated

* Tour Chart
  - Moved options from the pref page into the chart options slideout 
    - Graph line transparency
    - Draw line graphs with antialiasing


* 2D Map
  - Moved action "Show earth map" from the toolbar into the map context menu
