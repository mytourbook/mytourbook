Changes
=======

* Transform Opacity
  - It is possible, that existing opacity values must be adjusted because they are not migrated
  - Selecting/entering opacity values 0...100 or 0...255 is not user friendly. 
    With this new transformation, which is defined in the user preferences, opacity values could be selected between e.g. 0...8 which is then transformed to 0...255

* Tour Chart
  - Moved the options
    - Graph line transparency
    - Draw line graphs with antialiasing
    from the pref page into the chart options slideout
