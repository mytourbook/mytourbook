* Tour Filter

  - Filter tours by tour fields additonally to Person/Tour type/Tour photo
  
  - Problem with Linux (Windows do not have this problem)
    When the calendar area of a date widget in a filter property is hovered with the mouse and the calendar area is outside of the slideout border, then the calendar area will be closed.
    Workaround: Enlarge the slideout
    Background: Linux creates a shell for each date widget and this shell cannot be controled from outside of the widget

* Statistics

  - Show number of tours in week/month/year summary
  - Select bar chart type between adjacent/stacked for week/month/year summary
