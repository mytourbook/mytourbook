25.next.0                                                 ?. February 2025


TODO's
======

* Support column width = 0
  This is now (17.3.2024) set but needs more testing

* Support first column alignment in all views
 
* Maybe replace "Display.getDefault()" with "PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay()"
  "Code should always ask the workbench for the display rather than rely on Display.getDefault()"
  http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbench.html#getDisplay%28%29

* Website         - IDE pref page: Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
