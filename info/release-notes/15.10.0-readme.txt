Version 15.10.0                                         12. October 2015


New Last Minute Feature
=======================

* Collated Tours
    - Collate tours by tour type.
    - This brand-new feature have not yet the same quality as other 
      features, e.g. tours are not reselected/expanded after reopening.


New I
=====	

* Tour Chart
    - Show multiple tours.
    - Show title and tour info tooltip for each tour.
    - Customize tour info.
    - HR zones can only be displayed for multiple tours when an active 
      person is selected, it is not available when 'All People' is 
      selected.
    - Show only (filter) tour markers which contain a description.
    - Show relative position value in the zoom marker.
    - Zoom in/out with smaller steps when <Alt> key is pressed.
    - Accelerate horizontal scrolling with mouse wheel and 
      <Ctrl>+<Shift> keys.
    - Force min/max values for all graphs.

Limits
------
This new feature is not yet optimized for all areas in the application.
Some lists, e.g. time slice list in the tour editor or segment list in 
the tour segmenter can freeze the App when hundreds or thousands of 
tours are selected, it depends on the number of time slices. To prevent 
this, just hide or close critical views.

The above chart contains more than 4'000'000 time slices and works very 
well in the tour chart. The graph is optimized but currently it lacks 
some details (can be improved).


New II
======	

* Tour Segmenter
    - Support multiple tours.
    - Set properties (value, font, opacity ...) how segments are 
      displayed in the tour chart.

* Tour Segments in the Tour Chart
    - Show segment values for all graphs.
    - Segment tooltip.
    - Navigate/select tour segments in the tour chart with mouse or 
      keyboard.


Improvements
============	

* Map2
    - Draw map scale with rounded units and without black/white color 
      (I always puzzled how to interpret the scale colors).
    - Prevent redrawing for multiple tours.
    - Center map with both sliders, e.g. when a segment or multiple 
      segments are selected in the tour segmenter 
      (this solved a very long annoying behaviour).

* Tour Editor
    - Customize number of displayed digits for the lat/lon column 
      values.

* Tour Marker View
    - Support multiple selected tours.

* FIT Import
    - Ignore tour markers at the end of the tour, can be configured in 
      the Fit pref pages.
    - Replace time slices when it exceeds a selected duration.
      This fixes a device bug because the .fit file contained a time 
      slice with more than 17 years.

* NMEA import
	- Merged date fix from Alexey.

* Reimport
	A tour reimport can now also be done only for
    - Tour markers.
    - Power and speed values.


Bugfix
======	

* Photo
    - Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when tour contains only 
      1 time slice.
