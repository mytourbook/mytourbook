Version 18.12.0                                        11. December 2018


This is VERY important
======================
Create a BACKUP of your tour data BEFORE you start version 18.12

Why ?

Version 18.12 will upgrade the tour database to a new database version. 
After this is done, there is NO possibility to open the tour database 
with an older version of MyTourbook.

Improvements
============	

* Search Tours
  The tour fulltext index is now updated when a tour/marker/waypoint is 
  modified/added/deleted.

  The Search Tours  view is NOT updated automatically, this needs to be 
  done manually either by entering a modified search text or changing 
  the Search Options.

  An automatically update of this view would need some UI adjustments, 
  however this UI will be deprecated later on and is being replaced with
  a new UI, therefor it is now in maintanance mode.
 

* Map 2D
  Increased max zoom level 18 -> 19 for the default map (OpenStreetMap)

 
* Tour Info View
  Shows all internal fiels for a tour

 
System 	
======

* Derby database 10.14.2
* Lucene fulltext search engine 7.5.0
