UI Themes
=========

* MyTourbook is now using the Eclipse "e4_default" theme, other internal themes can also be used by adding one of these commandline parameters (including dash!):

   -cssTheme org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_classic
   -cssTheme org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default
   -cssTheme org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark

  The "dark" theme can be used but MyTourbook is not yet prepared for it 
  The "classic" theme is a little bit different compared with the theme in MyTourbook before 20.8
