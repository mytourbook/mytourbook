21.3.0                                                 22. March 2021

EXPERIMENTAL
============
Version 21.3 is experimental as the app launch has been reworked to fix 
the issues why the previous two versions were removed.
Create a backup of the data directory BEFORE installing this version.


New   
===

* Cloud: Suunto App Integration (Frederic) 299
  - Download tours (FIT format)
  - Upload tours as routes to be used for navigation
 
* Cloud: Strava Integration (Frederic) 273
  - Upload tours to a Strava account

* Compress Database
  The internal sql database can be compressed.
  During the update of MyTourbook for this version 21.3, the latitude/
  longitude values are saved with half of the previous size. 
  This can reduce the diskspace by many (> 100) MBytes, when the 
  database is compressed after the update.


Improvements   
============

* Easy Import
  - Prevent that lines are wrapped in the import file list (the UI do 
    not look very good). This can occur when a space is in a filename or 
    am/pm is displayed

* Fit Import
  - Import R-R intervals

* TCX Export (Frederic) 287
  - Added speed and power values in the TCX exports

* Tour Chart
  - Show heartbeat values as
    - Beat values from device (less accurate)
    - R-R intervals (saved in milliseconds)
  - Pace graph (Frederic)
    - Added checkbox to select the pace graph display type
      - When checked (default behavior), it will display the pace graph 
        in descending order to show the low paces (high speeds) at the 
        top of the graph and the high paces (low speeds) at the bottom 
        of the graph for a more intuitive chart
      - When unchecked, the opposite will be displayed
  - Marker Tooltip (Frederic)
    - Show/hide
      - Elevation, Elevation Gain Difference
      - Distance, Distance Difference
      - Duration, Duration Difference 

* 2D Map (Frederic) 289
  - Export map view to an image file (jpeg, png or bmp) or to the clipboard
  - Set a "User-Agent" for a custom map provider

* Tour Blog
  - Set content font size

* Tour Database
  - Overhauled the app (database) startup to have a different version 
    checking for the database structure and database data

 
Changes  
=======

* 2D Map
  - Minor reordering of the context menu actions

* Latitude/longitude values are saved in E6 format
  - This reduces the precision in the worst case (at the equator) 
    to 0.11132m which is less than the accuracy of the GPS system, 
    see accuracy

* Dropbox Integration (Frederic) 277
  - Switched to the new PKCE OAuth2 flow.
    The Implicit grant flow previously used is now considered deprecated 
    by Dropbox: "Legacy. We recommend the PKCE flow."
  - Because Dropbox doesn't support Web Views, the authorization is now 
    done in the user's default browser. See the PR link for the details 
    about the new authorization steps
     

Bugfix   
======

* Measurement System
  - A few measurement system values were wrong fb2755bd

* Fit Import (Frederic)
  - When importing a file without pauses, the recorded time could 
    sometimes be different by 1 or 2 seconds compared to the elapsed time

* TCX Import (Frederic)
  - The pause import for some TCX formats could lead to multiple 
    erroneous pauses

* TCX Export (Frederic) 287
  - Fixed the TCX Course Export format as it was not properly formatted 
    before and was preventing from importing TCX Courses in Garmin Connect

* Suunto SML & XML Import (Frederic)
  - Markers are now imported
  - Fixed possible NPE

* Pause Re-Import (Frederic)
  - In some scenarii, the pause re-import could be incomplete if the tour 
    originally contained pauses and the new file doesn't contain any

* Day Time Statistics (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug where dragging the horizontal sliders dragged the 
    opposite slider. Also, the value of the sliders were inverted 

* Dialog Adjust Elevation
  - Show dialog tour chart with a better default size when opened 
    the first time
    
* Tour Database Update
  - Fixed 3 different issues when updating tour database from the very 
    first public database version 3. These issues occurred, depending on 
    the version which is being updated
    - Column renaming could fail
    - Serie data could be dropped
    - Entity manager was running in update 3 → 4,
      moved it into the 3 → 4 post update
