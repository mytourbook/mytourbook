  @wolfgang-ch In the Strava guidelines, I read this : https://developers.strava.com/guidelines/
  "All apps must display the “Powered by Strava” logo or “Compatible with Strava” logo on all websites, apps and any distributable media such as images, videos or prints. No variations or modifications are acceptable."

  I am thinking you could display the logo "Compatible With Strava" on the website in the next release and that would comply with their requirements ?


* Website: Update Eclipse IDE for developers, see Thomas mail - https://mytourbook.sourceforge.io/mytourbook/index.php/development/dev-ide/development-env-installation

Issues
======

*  

  
New
===

* Suunto App Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/299
  - Download tours (FIT format)
  - Upload tours as routes to be used for navigation

* Strava Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/273
  - Upload tours to a Strava account

* Compress Database
  This tool can compress the internal sql database. After updating MyTourbook to 21.3, the latitude/longitude values are saved with half of the previous size. This reduced the diskspace by e.g. 110 MByte when the database was compressed after the migration.


Improvements
============

* Easy Import
  - Prevent that lines are wrapped in the import file list because it do not look very good. This can occur when a space is in a filename or am/pm is displayed

* Fit Import
  - Import R-R intervals

* TCX Export (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/287
  - Added the speed and power values in the TCX exports

* Tour Chart
  - Show heartbeat values as
    - Beat values from device (less accurate)
    - R-R intervals (saved in milliseconds)

  - Marker Tooltip (Frederic)
    - Show/hide 
      Elevation, Elevation Gain Difference 
      Distance, Distance Difference
      Duration, Duration Difference

  - Pace graph (Frederic)
    - Added checkbox to select the pace graph display type. 
      When checked (default behavior), it will display the pace graph in descending order to show the low paces (high speeds) at the top of the graph and the high paces (low speeds) at the bottom of the graph for a more intuitive chart. 
      When unchecked, the opposite will be displayed.

* 2D Map (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/289
 - Export map view to an image file (jpeg, png or bmp) or to the clipboard
 - Set a "User-Agent" for a custom map provider
    
* Tour Blog
  - Set content font size

* Tour Database
  - Overhauled the database startup to have different design version and data version checking


Changes  
=======

* 2D Map
  - Minor reordering of the context menu actions

* Latitude/longitude values are saved in E6 format
  This reduces the precision in the worst case (at the equator) to 0.11132m which is less than the accuracy of the GPS system, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6059691/android-google-map-accuracy-issue

* Dropbox Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/277
  - Switched to the new PKCE OAuth2 flow (The Implicit grant flow previously used is now considered deprecated by Dropbox: "[Legacy. We recommend the PKCE flow.]")
  - Because Dropbox doesn't support Web Views, the authorization is now done in the user's default browser. See the PR link for the details about the new authorization steps
    

Bugfix
======

* A few measurement system values were wrong

* Fit Import (Frederic)
  - When importing a file without pauses, the recorded time could sometimes be different by 1 or 2 seconds compared to the elapsed time.

* TCX Import (Frederic)
  - The pause import for some TCX formats could lead to multiple erroneous pauses

* TCX Export (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/287
  - Fixed the TCX Course Export format as it was not properly formatted before and was preventing from importing TCX Courses in Garmin Connect

* Suunto SML & XML Import (Frederic)
  - Markers are now imported
  - Fixed possible NPE

* Pause Re-Import (Frederic)
  - In some scenarii, the pause re-import could be incomplete if the tour originally contained pauses and the new file doesn't contain any

* Day Time Statistics (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug where dragging the horizontal sliders dragged the opposite slider. Also, the value of the sliders were inverted.

* Dialog Adjust Elevation
  - Show dialog tour chart with a better default size when opened the first time 
  
* Tour Database Update
  Fixed 3 different issues when updating tour database from the very first public version 3.
  These issues occurred, depending on the version which is being updated 
    - Column renaming could fail
    - Serie data could be dropped
    - Entity manager was running in update 3->4, moved it into the 3->4 post update
