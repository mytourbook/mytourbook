New

2.5D Map

    accumulated values in the Tour Data Editor View

Improvements
============

TCX Import (Frederic)
  - Import of calories and average power values

    4k displays


Changes
=======

Tour Search
  - After some testing and no app crashes, the embedded browser is now
    also used in Linux. The old behaviour can be enabled by setting the
    command line parameter "-DforceBrowserForTourSeachInLinux"
    when starting MyTourbook
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1000

Map Player -> Model Player
  - The "Map Player" view was renamed to "Model Player" view. Ignore the
    following error, close this view and open the "Model Player" view
  
2 Year Digits -> 4 Year Digits
  - For some locales e.g. german the short formatting for a year has
    2 digits, this is now changed to 4 year digits


Experimental
============

Duplicate Tour
  - The action "Duplicate Tour" in the "Tour Book" context menu is now
    enabled for all tours, not only for manual tours as it was before.
    All data are now duplicated, e.g. data series, markers or photos except
    the reference tours. A "copy" label is appended to the tour title.
    Use this feature with care, mainly the duplicated tours, as it is
    not yet fully tested.
    One issue could be that when a duplicated tour is selected then it's
    data are not displayed because the original tour was selected before.
    This issue happened in the flat "Tour Book" view and is fixed.
    There are so many possibilities in MyTourbook where issues could
    occure that not all of them are tested now.
