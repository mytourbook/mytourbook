* Elapsed Time - Recorded Time - Paused Time (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/222
 
  Device time - when the user pressed start/stop/pause:
  - Elapsed time (formerly Recording Time)
  - Recorded Time (new)
  - Paused Time = Elapsed Time - Recorded Time (new)

  Computed time - is dependend on the break time algorithm:
  - Moving Time
  - Break Time = Elapsed Time - Moving Time
    
  - The recorded/paused time are imported from the following formats Garmin FIT, Suunto (Ambit 2 xml, Ambit 2 sml, Suunto Spartan/9 .json.gz), SportTracks Fitlog, Garmin TCX
  - Added the ability to re-import, for existing tours, only the timer pauses (and hence also the recorded time)
  - The new tour times (Recorded & Paused Times) are available for display in the TourDataEditor, TourBook view, Calendar view & Statistics view
  - 2D Map: Added the ability to display/hide the location and duration of the tour pauses

* Statistic Values View
  - Displays the values of the statistic graphs
  - Statistic values can be copied in csv format to the clipboard

* Tour Tag Filter
  - Tags can also be combined with AND, so a tour will only be displayed when it contain ALL selected tags. 
    In the previous version, tags were combined with OR, so a tour was displayed when it contained ONE of the selected tags. 
  - Unchecked tags in the "Selected Tags" list will also be saved in the tag filter profile, in the previous version they got lost.
    These unchecked tags can be deleted with the DELETE key in the "Selected Tags" or by unchecking it in "Available Tags"

  - When re-importing data, the previous and current data is displayed (whenever possible) in the Log view to show the users the differences before and after the re-import
  - Added the ability for the user to skip a file if the filepath is unknown or not found
  - Correct the import filepath location (Wolfgang)
  - Re-import tours between two dates (Wolfgang)
  - Re-import keeps manually selected paths during a session and tries to reuse it for subsequent files when necessary (Wolfgang)
