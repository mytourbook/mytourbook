Experimental
============

* VERSION 21.9 IS EXPERIMENTAL
  The import / re-import and save process has been completely reworked 
  to run it concurrently, with the advantage that this is now many times 
  faster, depending on the number of CPU cores  


New
===

* Device Battery SoC (State of Charge)   
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_charge
  - Import/Re-import SoC values from .fit files
  - Show in 
    - New "Battery SoC" statistics
    - New columns in "Tour Book" view
    - Tour info tooltip


Improvements
============

* Tour Import
  - Ask the user to replace the import filename in a saved tour, when 
    the import filename is different or empty

* Fitlog/FitlogEx Import (Frederic)
  - The timezone is used only when available, otherwise it's determined 
    with the GPS position

* GPX Import 
  - Expanded geo diff and time diff to not skip waypoints when converted 
    into tour markers, before the time and distance was too narrow when 
    a waypoint was converted into a tour marker

    repair feature is performed when MyTourbook is closing.
    This is an experimental feature and can be activated with the 
    command line parameter -DsetAllViewsClosable 

* 2.5D & 3D Maps (Frederic)
  - Export map view to an image file (jpeg, png or bmp) or to the clipboard


Changes  
=======

* 2D Map
  - Moved option "Show hovered/selected tour" from "2D Map Options" into 
    "Track Options"

* 2.5D Map (Thomas)
  - Direction arrows modified so they looking like the arrows in 2D Map
  - Bolder trackline, when direction arrows are enabled
  - Enabled building extrusion also for mapilion map
  - Photolayer on top of all other layers


Bugfix
======

* Tour Re-import
  - Elevation up/down values were not re-imported
    https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/125/
    
* Tour Chart
  - Fixed height of the x-axis: The x-axis text could be vertically 
    truncated when the system font is too large

* 2D Map
  - Fixed: "when reaching maxzoom, dont shift the map anymore" 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/370
 
* 3D Map (Frederic)
  - Fixed an issue that could happen under Linux with ATI graphic cards 
    and that could make the 3D map view crash 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/383

* Tour Marker View (Frederic)
 - The average speed and pace values are now computed using the distance 
   and time values instead of using the speed serie values. Previously, 
   this could lead to erroneous values.
   https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/79364ad998/ 

* Tour Cadence Zones Times (Frederic)
  - Cadence zone times computation should use either the recorded time 
    or moving time per the computed values preference 

* 4k Display
  - Fixed positions for the vertical x-Axis units and vertical tour 
    chart markers
  - Line width was growing on every paint event 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/356
