Experimental
============

* VERSION 21.9 IS EXPERIMENTAL
  The import / re-import and save process has been completely reworked 
  to run it concurrently, with the advantage that this is now many times 
  faster, depending on the number of CPU cores  


New
===

* Device Battery SoC (State of Charge)   
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_charge
  - Import/Re-import SoC values from .fit files
  - Show in 
    - New "Battery SoC" statistics
    - New columns in "Tour Book" view
    - Tour info tooltip


Improvements
============

* Tour Import
  - Ask the user to replace the import filename in a saved tour, when 
    the import filename is different or empty

* Fitlog/FitlogEx Import (Frederic)
  - The timezone is used only when available, otherwise it's determined 
    with the GPS position

* GPX Import 
  - Expanded geo diff and time diff to not skip waypoints when converted 
    into tour markers, before the time and distance was too narrow when 
    a waypoint was converted into a tour marker

      with all tours

* Repair Close Button in All Views
  - It can happen that the close button in the view tab disappear. This 
    repair feature is performed when MyTourbook is closing.
    This is an experimental feature and can be activated with the 
    command line parameter -DsetAllViewsClosable 


Changes  
=======

* 2D Map
  - Moved option "Show hovered/selected tour" from "2D Map Options" into 
    "Track Options"

* 2.5D Map (Thomas)
  - Direction arrows modified so they looking like the arrows in 2D Map
  - Bolder trackline, when direction arrows are enabled
  - Enabled building extrusion also for mapilion map
  - Photolayer on top of all other layers


Bugfix
======

* Tour Re-import
  - Elevation up/down values were not re-imported
    https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/bugs/125/
    
* Tour Chart
  - Fixed height of the x-axis: The x-axis text could be vertically 
    truncated when the system font is too large

* 2D Map
  - Fixed: "when reaching maxzoom, dont shift the map anymore" 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/370
 
* 3D Map (Frederic)
  - Fixed an issue that could happen under Linux with ATI graphic cards 
    and that could make the 3D map view crash 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/383

* Tour Marker View (Frederic)
 - The average speed and pace values are now computed using the distance 
   and time values instead of using the speed serie values. Previously, 
   this could lead to erroneous values.
   https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/79364ad998/ 

* Tour Cadence Zones Times (Frederic)
  - Cadence zone times computation should use either the recorded time 
    or moving time per the computed values preference 

* 4k Display
  - Fixed positions for the vertical x-Axis units and vertical tour 
    chart markers
  - Line width was growing on every paint event 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/356
