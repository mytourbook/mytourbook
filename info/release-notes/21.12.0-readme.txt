Improvements
============

* Easy Import                          
  - New import launcher option: Replace the elevation value of the first 
    time slice with the elevation value from the second time slice
    This is fixing an issue after updating the Garmin Edge 1030 firmware 
    version to 12.20, mostly it has total wrong elevation value for the 
    first time slice

* GPX Import
  - Tours can be imported also with the date/time format 
    "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSS"

* Tour Marker View (Frederic)          
  - Added the ability to select between elapsed, moving and recorded time

Changes

Bugfix
======

* Tour Chart                           
  - When moving a slider with the keyboard or mouse wheel, it did not 
    move the selected time slice in the tour editor
  
  https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/403


* Tour Marker Editor (Frederic)
  - When opening the dialog, the focus was not set in the label (Linux only)
  - When double clicking on a marker label combo entry, the tour 
    marker name was not updated

 
* Tour Segmenter
  - 2 labels where hidden in the break time segmenter, propably since 21.9 
    but there were no code modifications in MT, maybe because of changes 
    in the SWT framework


Translation    
===========

- Dutch (Maarten)
- French (Frederic)
- German

 
System   
======

* FIT SDK 21.67
