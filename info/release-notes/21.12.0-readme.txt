Improvements
============

* Easy Import           420   https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/420
  - New import launcher option: Replace the elevation value of the first time slice with the elevation value from the second time slice
    This is fixing an issue after updating the Garmin Edge 1030 firmware version to 12.20, mostly it has total wrong elevation value for the first time slice
  

* GPX Import
  - Tours can be imported also with the date/time format "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSS"

* Tour Marker View (Frederic)
  - Added the ability to select between elapsed, moving and recorded time

Changes

Bugfix
======

* Tour Chart            403   https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/403
  When moving a slider with the keyboard or mouse wheel, it did not move the selected time slice in the tour editor

* Tour Marker Editor (Frederic)
  - When opening the dialog, the focus was not set in the label (Linux only)
  - When double clicking on a marker label combo entry, the tour marker name was not updated
 
* Tour Segmenter
  - 2 labels where hidden in the break time segmenter, propably since 21.9 but there were no code modifications in MT, maybe because of changes in the SWT framework
