Version 18.2.0                                          27. January 2018


Improvements
============	

* Map 2.5D

  - Navigation with the keyboard

  - Flickering is solved https://github.com/mapsforge/vtm/issues/257, 
    now there is no need to adjust the NVIDIA Buffer-flipping mode as 
    described in 17.9.0

 
* Calendar

  - Set color for todays date

  - Changed week/tour layout
  
    Old: When year columns are displayed and the column start is not 
         continuously, the last and first week in adjacent columns 
         contained a tour two times
       
    New: A tour is displayed only once in the correct column, this 
         solved some existing navigation/positioning bugs


* Tour Book View

  - Link a tour in the tour book view when a tour is selected in another 
    directory view

 
System
======	

* Map 2.5D

  Separated platform files into plugin fragments, the executables are 
  now a little bit smaller

* Build process with 1 Click

  All product files are now build with one gradle script. This is 
  calling already existing build scripts which are producing parts of 
  the product. This highly complex process takes about 3 minutes and is 
  using these tools:
  
  - Gradle
  - Ant
  - Maven with Tycho
