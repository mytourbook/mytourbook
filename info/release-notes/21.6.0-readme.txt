Changes  
=======

* Fitlog/FitlogEx import (Frederic)

  - When re-importing tours, the complete list of tour types and tags 
    are not re-imported anymore

 
* SRTM Download

  - The download of SRTM data files is still free but it requires that a 
    user is authenticated. Username and password can be entered in the 
    SRTM data preferences page which also contains information how to 
    request a SRTM server account

 
Bugfix   
======

* Fitlog/FitlogEx import (Frederic)

  - Fixed an issue where in some cases the imported tour time zone could 
    be wrong


* FIT File: Pause Re-Import (Frederic)

  - In some scenarii, the pause import could be erroneous and lead to 
    negative paused time values

 
* Tour Import View (Frederic)

  - The kcal column was displaying values in calories units instead of 
    kcalories

 
* Statistic Values View (Frederic)

  - Fixed a bug where the elevation gain value was incorrect


* Tour Chart

  - R-R values were not visible within tour breaks 
  - Create Tourmarker: Same wording as on other places. 
    "create marker" -> "create tour marker" (Thomas)

 
* Tour Chart Tooltip (Frederic)

  - Displaying the hour from 0 when a new day starts


* Tour Chart Value Tooltip  (Frederic)

  - Fixed a bug when importing tours (FIT, Suunto SML, Suunto XML, 
    Garmin TCX) where in some cases, the tour start components were 
    erroneous (the Time of Day value in the Value Point Tooltip was 
    wrong). Now this data is adjusted with the tour's time zone.

 
* Tour Data Editor

  - Ctrl+S was setting the tour dirty again on Linux 124

 
* Tour Type Preference page (Frederic)

  - Fixed a bug in the tour type viewer when selecting several tour 
    types and only the first one was deleted
  - Disabling the "Rename" button when more than 1 tour type is selected
