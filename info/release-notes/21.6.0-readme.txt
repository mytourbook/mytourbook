21.6.0                                                 ?. June 2021


TODO's
======

* Website      - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                 Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

               - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                 mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
  
New
===

* Dark Theme - https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/319
  - Select the UI theme in the preference
  - Lots and lots of color and symbol adjustments to make the dark design look really good now, but it's not 100% perfect yet

* Tour Book View (Frederic)
 - Added the ability to delete values, for any given tour, such as elevation, time, gear, cadence...etc

* Tour values deletion/re-import (Frederic)
 - Added a confirmation dialog that will always be displayed to the user when re-importing or deleting tour values for the whole database
 - Locking by default the UI controls to modify tour values on more than 1 tour at a time
 - Separated calories in its own category


Improvements
============

* Tour Chart 
  - Displaying the night sections with a grey color for a more intuitive chart and better readability (Frederic)
  - More options to show R-R values together with other pules graphs (R-R average, device value)

* 2D Map (Frederic)
  - Extending the zoom levels capacity from 20 to 23

* 2.5D Map (Thomas)
  - Upgrading VTM lib to 0.15 321 and further to 0.16 349
  - Size of photothumbnails can be changed via slideout 326
  - Show direction arrows on the tourpath, controlled via slideout 339
  - Tourtrack and Sliderpath have round ends like in map2 349

* 3D Map & Tour Chart Preferences (Frederic)
 - "Squeezed" several transparency values to be in between 0 and 100 instead of 0 & 255 or 0.0 and 1.0


Changes  
=======

* Fitlog/FitlogEx import (Frederic)
  - When re-importing tours, the complete list of tour types and tags are not re-imported anymore
    
* SRTM Download
  - The download of SRTM data files is still free but it requires that a user is authenticated. Username and password can be entered in the SRTM data preferences page which also contains information how to request a SRTM server account 


Bugfix
======

* Fitlog/FitlogEx import (Frederic)
  - Fixed an issue where in some cases the imported tour time zone could be wrong

* FIT File: Pause Re-Import (Frederic)
  - In some scenarii, the pause import could be erroneous and lead to negative paused time values

* Tour Import View (Frederic)
  - The kcal column was displaying values in calories units instead of kcalories

* Statistic Values View (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug where the elevation gain value was incorrect
  
* Tour Chart
  - R-R values were not visible within tour breaks - https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/318 
  - Create Tourmarker: Same wording as on other places. "create marker" -> "create tour marker" 331 (Thomas)

* Tour Chart Tooltip (Frederic)
  - Displaying the hour from 0 when a new day starts

* Tour Chart Value Tooltip  (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug when importing tours (FIT, Suunto SML, Suunto XML, Garmin TCX) where in some cases, the tour start components were erroneous (the Time of Day value in the Value Point Tooltip was wrong). Now this data is adjusted with the tour's time zone.

* Tour Type Preference page (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug in the tour type viewer when selecting several tour types and only the first one was deleted.
  - Disabling the "Rename" button when more than 1 tour type is selected

* Map25 Mapprovider (Thomas)
  - Map was not displayed correctly at the very first start of Mytourbook 343
