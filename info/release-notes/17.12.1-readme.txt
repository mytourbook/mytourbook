* Migrate from 17.12.0 → 17.12.1

  Because of substancial changes in the calendar profile management, 
  new default profiles are created.

  The old profiles are still available with all it's customized 
  properties. They can be used or deleted and appear in the profile list
  with an empty name and a DEFAULT config.
 

Improvements
============	

* FIT Import

  -  Import enhanced altitude+speed values

  -  Saving speed data has changed:

  -  By default, speed values will not be saved anymore (when 
     availabel), this can be configured in the preferences

  -  Reorganized fit import preferences


Bugfix
======
	
* FIT Calorie Values

  Until now, ALL calorie values from the FIT import, are saved in kcal  
  and not in calories, so they are too small by the factor 1000. 
  Calories are used internally for the maths.
 
  This version contains the new tool...

  Multiply calories value by 1000...

  ...in the tour book view to fix the wrong saved values.

  With the FIT SDK, the calorie values can be read only in kcal, so 
  multiplying by 1000 does not change the accuracy.


  Additional UI updates for the calories values

  -  Calories column in the tour book view show now kcal  instead of 
     calories

  -  The calendar view can show kcal/MJ  values

  -  Edit kcal  values instead of cal values in the Tour Editor and 
     Quick Tour Editor
 

System
======	

* Debug Data

  - Documented debug commandline arguments
