21.next.0                                                 ?.Month 2021


TODO's
======

https://adoptium.net/ Temurin


* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

Improvements
============

* Easy Import           420   https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/420
  - New import launcher option: Replace the elevation value of the first time slice with the elevation value from the second time slice
    This is fixing an issue after updating the Garmin Edge 1030 firmware version to 12.20, mostly it has total wrong elevation value for the first time slice

Changes  
=======

Bugfix
======

* Tour Chart            403   https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/403
  When moving a slider with the keyboard or mouse wheel, it did not move the selected time slice in the tour editor

 
* Tour Segmenter
  - 2 labels where hidden in the break time segmenter, propably since 21.9 but there were no code modifications in MT, maybe because of changes in the SWT framework
