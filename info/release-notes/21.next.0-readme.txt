TODO's
======

* Tour Chart   - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
               - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Tour Search  - Test Edge browser if the tour selection in the result list is working with the mouse
               - Implement workaround: Select tour with an action in the context menu

* Compare Tours by Elevation
               - Make it concurrent, with many tours it gets really slow which was not a problem in the beginning of MT               

* Website      - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                 Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

               - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                 mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

* Tour modification (Frederic) 
               - Use multi-threading (ThreadPoolExecutor)
