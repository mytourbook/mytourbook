TODO's
======

* Website: Describe structure for text key names

* Website: Set next version experimental because of the many database modifications

* Website: Document cloud connections

  @wolfgang-ch In the Strava guidelines, I read this : https://developers.strava.com/guidelines/
  "All apps must display the “Powered by Strava” logo or “Compatible with Strava” logo on all websites, apps and any distributable media such as images, videos or prints. No variations or modifications are acceptable."

  I am thinking you could display the logo "Compatible With Strava" on the website in the next release and that would comply with their requirements ?

* Website - Map2: Map providers list in https://osmlab.github.io/editor-layer-index/

* Website - Tour Search: Show tip how to select a tour in the search result https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/2471c3da16/?limit=100#cce3
