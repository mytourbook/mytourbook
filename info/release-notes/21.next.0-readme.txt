TODO's
======

* SRTM         Fix access to SRTM data

* Tour Chart   Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
 
* Tour Search  - Test Edge browser if the tour selection in the result list is working with the mouse
               - Implement workaround: Select tour with an action in the context menu

* Geo Filter   Investigate/fix https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/23132f7fbf/?limit=25#fbeb

               https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.18/platform.php#system-theme
               -cssTheme org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_classic
               -cssTheme org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default
               -cssTheme org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
  
* Website      Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
               Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

Bugfix
======

* Tour Chart
  - R-R values were not visible within tour breaks

* Tour Chart Value Tooltip 
  - Fixed a bug when importing tours (FIT, Suunto SML, Suunto XML, Garmin TCX) where in some cases, the tour start components were erroneous (the Time of Day value in the Value Point Tooltip was wrong). Now this data is adjusted with the tour's time zone.

* Tour Import View (Frederic)
  - The kcal column was displaying values in calories units instead of kcalories

* Chart Tooltip (Frederic)
  - Displaying the hour from 0 when a new day starts

  Fixed SQL exception when the tour database size is too large to fit into an integer value
