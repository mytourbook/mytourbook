TODO's
======


* Compare Tours by Elevation
                  - Make it concurrent, with many tours it gets really slow which was not a problem in the beginning of MT               

* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
                 

* Tour modification (Frederic) 
                  - Use multi-threading (ThreadPoolExecutor)

Improvements
============

* Compare tours by elevation
  - Reference tour view
    - New shortcut action in context menu to compare reference tour(s) with all tours
    - A newly create reference tour is selected in this view
  - Compare result view
    - Compare tours concurrently -> much less waiting time
    - Use fast app tour filters (person, tour type, tour, photo...)
    - Filter tour compare results between all/saved/not saved
    - Automatically expand reference tour in compare result view, after comparison is done
    - New shortcut action in context menu to compare reference tour(s) with all tours
    - Tour comparison can be restarted with other parameters, e.g. different years, other tour filter
  - Year statistic view
    - Show reference tour title
    - Show year statistic view in "Compare Result" perspective
    - Update year statistic view when compare result is assigned/removed

* Repair close button in all views
  - It can happen that the close button in the view tab disappear. This repair feature is performed when MyTourbook is closing.
    This is an experimental feature and can be activated with the command line parameter -DsetAllViewsClosable 

* Fitlog/FitlogEx import (Frederic)
  - The timezone is used only when available, otherwise it's determined with the GPS position
