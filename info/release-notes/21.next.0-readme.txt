21.next.0                                                 ?. Month 2021


TODO's
======

* Website: Document cloud connections

  @wolfgang-ch In the Strava guidelines, I read this : https://developers.strava.com/guidelines/
  "All apps must display the “Powered by Strava” logo or “Compatible with Strava” logo on all websites, apps and any distributable media such as images, videos or prints. No variations or modifications are acceptable."

  I am thinking you could display the logo "Compatible With Strava" on the website in the next release and that would comply with their requirements ?

* Website - Map2: Map providers list in https://osmlab.github.io/editor-layer-index/

* Website - Tour Search: Show tip how to select a tour in the search result https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/2471c3da16/?limit=100#cce3

* Frederic : Remove the unused redirect_uri in the Dropbox app console once the new version is released

Changes

* 2D Map
  - Reordered context menu actions a little bit


Bugfix
======

* A few measurement system values were wrong

* Fit Import (Frederic)
  - When importing a file without pauses, the recorded time could sometimes be different by 1 or 2 seconds compared to the elapsed time.

* TCX Import (Frederic)
  - The pause import for some TCX formats could lead to multiple erroneous pauses

* Pause Re-Import (Frederic)
  - In some scenarii, the pause re-import could be imcomplete if the tour originally contained pauses and the new file doesn't contain any

* TCX Export (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/287
  - Fixed the TCX Course Export format as it was not properly formatted before and was preventing from importing TCX Courses in Garmin Connect
