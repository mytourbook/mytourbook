21.next.0                                                 Day.Month 2021


TODO's
======

* Mac OS          - Remove it https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/b3e1a1c532/#3ace

* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Tour Search     - Test Edge browser if the tour selection in the result list is working with the mouse
                  - Implement workaround: Select tour with an action in the context menu

* Compare Tours by Elevation
               - Make it concurrent, with many tours it gets really slow which was not a problem in the beginning of MT               

* Website      - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                 Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

               - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                 mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

* Tour modification (Frederic) 
               - Use multi-threading (ThreadPoolExecutor)

Issues

Improvements
============

* 2D Map
  - Enable/disable map dimming, moved map dimming parameters into "2D Map Options" slideout
  - Legend units and scale colors depend on the map dim level
  

* Tour Chart
  - Show value of the hovered graph point  
  - Set the default graphs in the graph slideout, previously it could be set only in the pref dialog
  - Show values in the value point tooltip with the correct color when using the dark theme  


* Tour Data Editor
  - New action to delete time sliced and adjust the tour start time
    This can be helpfull when a GPS device had no connection at the tour start and the tour start time is totally wrong.
    The author had a tour whose tour start time was postponed 19 hours until the GPS signal was received


Changes  
=======

* Strava Upload (Frederic)
 - Enhanced the tour type comparison when mapping tour types to Strava activity types
