TODO's
======


* Compare Tours by Elevation
                  - Make it concurrent, with many tours it gets really slow which was not a problem in the beginning of MT               

* Tour Chart      - Select color for 2nd graph line instead of compliment color
                  - Set default graphs in the graph slideout, sorting still needs the pref page

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
                 

* Tour modification (Frederic) 
                  - Use multi-threading (ThreadPoolExecutor)

Improvements
============

* 2D map
  - Show tour direction as marker in the tour track

* Compare tours by elevation
  - Reference tour view
    - Show compared tours with year categories or without year categories
    - New shortcut action in context menu to compare reference tours with all tours
    - A newly create reference tour is selected in this view and perspective
  - Compare result view
    - Compare tours concurrently -> much less waiting time
    - Use fast app tour filters (person, tour type, tour, photo...)
    - Tour compare results can be filtered by: all/saved/not saved
    - Automatically expand reference tour in compare result view after a comparison is done
    - New shortcut action in context menu to compare reference tour(s) with all tours
    - Tour comparison can be restarted with other parameters, e.g. different years, other tour filters
  - Year statistic view
    - Show reference tour title
    - Show year statistic view in "Compare Result" perspective
    - Update year statistic view when compare result is assigned/removed

* Repair close button in all views
  - It can happen that the close button in the view tab disappear. This repair feature is performed when MyTourbook is closing.
    This is an experimental feature and can be activated with the command line parameter -DsetAllViewsClosable 

* Fitlog/FitlogEx import (Frederic)
  - The timezone is used only when available, otherwise it's determined with the GPS position

  - Fixed positions for the vertical x-Axis units and vertical tour chart markers
  - Line width was growing on every paint event https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/356

* Tour cadence zones times (Frederic)
  - Cadence zone times computation should use either the recorded time or moving
    time per the computed values preference
