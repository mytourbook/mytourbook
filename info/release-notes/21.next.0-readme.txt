TODO's

  @wolfgang-ch In the Strava guidelines, I read this : https://developers.strava.com/guidelines/
  "All apps must display the “Powered by Strava” logo or “Compatible with Strava” logo on all websites, apps and any distributable media such as images, videos or prints. No variations or modifications are acceptable."

  I am thinking you could display the logo "Compatible With Strava" on the website in the next release and that would comply with their requirements ?

* Website - Map2: Map providers list in https://osmlab.github.io/editor-layer-index/

* Website - Tour Search: Show tip how to select a tour in the search result https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/2471c3da16/?limit=100#cce3

Issues
======

*  

  
New
===

* Suunto App Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/299
  - Ability to download tours (FIT format)
  - Ability to upload tours as routes to be used for navigation

* Strava Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/273
  - Ability to upload tours to a Strava account.

* 2D Map (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/289
 - Added the possibility to configure a "User-Agent" for a custom map provider
 - Added the possibility to export the current map view to an image file (jpeg, png or bmp) or to the clipboard

* Compress Database
  This tool can compress the internal sql database. After updating MyTourbook to 21.2, the latitude/longitude values are saved with half of the previous size. This reduced the diskspace by e.g. 110 MByte when the database was compressed after the migration.


Improvements
============

* Fit Import
  - Import R-R intervals

* TCX Export (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/287
  - Added the speed and power values in the TCX exports

* Tour Chart
  - Show heartbeat values
    - Beat values from device
    - R-R intervals

  - Marker Tooltip (Frederic)
    - Ability to show/hide the following data: Elevation, Distance, Duration, Elevation Gain Difference, Distance Difference, Duration Difference
    
* Tour Blog
  - Set content font size

* Tour Database
  - Overhauled the database startup to have different design version and data version checking


Changes  
=======

* Dropbox Integration (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/277
  - Switched to the new PKCE OAuth2 flow (The Implicit grant flow previously used is now considered deprecated by Dropbox: "[Legacy. We recommend the PKCE flow.]")
  - Because Dropbox doesn't support Web Views, the authorization is now done in the user's default browser. See the PR link for the details about the new authorization steps

* 2D Map
  - Reordered context menu actions a little bit

* Latitude/longitude values are saved in E6 format
  This reduces the precision in the worst case (at the equator) to 0.11132m which is less than the accuracy of the GPS system

Bugfix
======

* A few measurement system values were wrong

* Fit Import (Frederic)
  - When importing a file without pauses, the recorded time could sometimes be different by 1 or 2 seconds compared to the elapsed time.

* TCX Import (Frederic)
  - The pause import for some TCX formats could lead to multiple erroneous pauses

* Pause Re-Import (Frederic)
  - In some scenarii, the pause re-import could be imcomplete if the tour originally contained pauses and the new file doesn't contain any

* TCX Export (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/287
  - Fixed the TCX Course Export format as it was not properly formatted before and was preventing from importing TCX Courses in Garmin Connect

* Dialog Adjust Elevation
  - Show dialog tour chart with a better default size when opened the first time 
  
* Tour Database Update
  Fixed 3 different issues when updating tour database from the very first public version 3.
  Depending on the version being updated, these issues occurred or not
    - Column renaming could fail
    - Serie data could be dropped
    - Entity manager was running in update 3->4, moved it into the 3->4 post update
