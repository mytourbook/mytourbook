TODO's

======  
* !!! Translators need new babel editor plugin when using Eclipse 2020-09 !!!
  http://mytourbook.sourceforge.net/mytourbook/index.php/development/translation/install-resource-editor

New
===

* Elapsed Time - Recorded Time - Paused Time (Frederic) https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/pull/222

    New time data:

    Elapsed time (formerly Recording Time)
    Recorded Time
    Paused Time (= Elapsed Time - Recorded Time)

    Existing time data:

    Moving Time
    Break Time ( = Elapsed Time - Moving Time)

 - The recorded/paused time are imported from the following formats Garmin FIT, Suunto (Ambit 2 xml, Ambit 2 sml, Suunto Spartan/9 .json.gz), SportTracks Fitlog, Garmin TCX
 - Added the ability to re-import, for existing tours, only the timer pauses (and hence also the recorded time).
 - The new tour times (Recorded & Paused Times) are available for display in the TourDataEditorView, TourBookView, Calendar view & Statistics View
 - 2D Map: Added the ability to display/hide the location and duration of the tour pauses

* Statistic Values View
  - Displays the values of the statistic graphs
  - Statistic values can be copied in csv format to the clipboard

Improvements
============

* Improved Cadence Support (rtdog)
  - Added new cadence type "none" for tours with no cadence
  - Added default cadence assignment during Easy Import Launcher when setting tour type
  - Created import preference for default cadence to use during import launcher configuration
  - Added language support for cadence type names (none/rpm/spm)

* Flat Tour Book View
  - Sort also by
    - Computed break time
  - Show markers and tags columns with the saved content (no dummy text)
  
* Tour Book View
  - Reimport keeps manually selected paths during a session and tries to reuse it for subsequent files when necessary.

* Calendar View
  - New toolbar action: Go to today

* Statistics View
  - New toolbar action: Copy statistic values to the clipboard
  - Show totals in the tooltip for all tour types in one time unit - https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/feature-requests/180/
  - Values in the statistic tooltip can be formatted differently than tour tooltips values
  
* Tour Tag Filter
  - Tags can also be combined with AND, so a tour will only be displayed when it contain ALL selected tags. 
    In the previous version, tags were combined with OR, so a tour was displayed when it contained ONE of the selected tags. 
  - Unchecked tags in the "Selected Tags" list will also be saved in the tag filter profile, in the previous version they got lost.
    These unchecked tags can be deleted with the DELETE key in the "Selected Tags" or by unchecking it in "Available Tags"

* Dialog Adjust Elevation
  - Adjustment Type: "Approach elevation with SRMT data"
    New action: "Set last point to SRTM elevation", this sets the elevation of the horizontally most right point to it's SRTM elevation value


Changes  
=======

* All time columns in the column profiles must be added because it's internal names are modified

  - All summarized values are wrong when a tour contains multiple tags and the tour tag filter is activated https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/223
  
* Tour Book View (flat)
  - Several SQL exception's when view is not sorted by a column
  
* Statistic View
  - Week graphs tooltip can show (it depends on the start year and number of displayed years) the wrong week/year number when the first week in a year is a weekyear from the previous year, e.g. 1. January 2016 -> week number: 53, weekyear: 2015
  - Month/year statistic shows the wrong time values in the tooltip when the tour types are resorted
